### [booking-calendar](https://irevall.github.io/booking-calendar/)
#### Notes:
- no tests, I haven't had a chance to learn testing yet
- pretty ugly, due to lack of detailed design (font, color scheme, more app states)
- convoluted logic, as I underestimated how complicated it might be and I didn't find enough time to properly think this through after I finally realized
- no animations
- I tried my best to give decent UX to date choosing, not sure if I succeeded
